## My website:

### Why did I create this site ?
Because swimming pool is very pleasant for people who want to swim and I love swimming pool to then i made it.

### Why "Peeseen" ?
It's a wordplay ! Pee & Seen because when somebody pee on the pool there is a yellow track floating, then the "Pee" were "Seen". End of quotes .. BOOM !
